    "# IS 362 – Week 5 Assignment: U.S. Airport Analysis with Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment focuses on applying Python and pandas to analyze real-world flight data from the [nycflights13 dataset](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13/tree/master/data-raw). The main goal is to answer three specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the northernmost airport in the United States?\n",
    "2. What is the easternmost airport in the United States?\n",
    "3. On February 12, 2013, which New York area airport experienced the windiest weather?\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the assignment, I will use Python and pandas to process the dataset, research external sources to confirm findings, and clearly document both my code and assumptions. The final deliverable will include the analysis, supporting research, and verified answers for each question in a well-organized Jupyter notebook.\n"

    "First, it appears that the latitude and longitude for **Dillant Hopkins Airport** were entered incorrectly, possibly swapped. The actual coordinates are most likely around **42.8° N** and **-72.27° W**. After correcting for this, we can determine that **Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport** in Alaska is the northernmost airport in the United States, which is confirmed by a quick Google search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easternmost Airports\n",
    "\n",
    "Some issues also appear in the top list of easternmost airports. Dillant Hopkins’ incorrect data shows up here as well. Additionally, if we simply take the largest longitude values, several airports appear with longitudes approaching **180°**, almost directly opposite Greenwich, England (0° longitude). Research shows that many of these locations are **U.S. military airports abroad**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to include only domestic airports, we need a different approach. One solution is to use pandas’ native functions `nsmallest()`, `iloc()`, and `index` to find the **absolute value** of the longitude column, select the smallest 5 values, and use their indexes to retrieve the corresponding rows:\n"
