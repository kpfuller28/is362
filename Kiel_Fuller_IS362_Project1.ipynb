    "# Flight Arrival Delays: ALASKA vs. AM WEST\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes arrival delay data for two airlines, ALASKA and AM WEST, across five major destinations: Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. The goal is to structure the raw data into a format suitable for analysis, import it into pandas, and compare delay patterns between the two airlines. By calculating totals, delay rates, and other basic metrics, we aim to identify which airline experiences more delays overall and whether certain destinations see higher delay frequencies. The findings will help illustrate how simple data management and analysis techniques in Python can reveal meaningful insights from real-world data.\n",

For example, you can see that both airlines run relatively on time at Phoenix, while Alaska signigicantly out performs AM West in San Francisco. \n"

    "We can determine a couple things from viewing the data as above. Overall, Alaska is more likely to be delayed as opposed to AM West. Despite having one of the largest amounts of delayed flights, Phoenix actually has the best on-time percentage. We can also see that while Alaska is more consistently on time to San Francisco, in general the destination makes a lot more of a difference in whether a flight is delayed rather than airline. "
